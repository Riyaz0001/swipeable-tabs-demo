  <h2>Further Notes</h2>
  <p>If your app also has a side menu you might need to add an additional config element to your Super Tabs lie this: 1
  <!-- <super tabs [config]="{ sideMenu: 'left' }"></super> -->
    Besides that setting you could also change the drag distance and threshold but the tabs are in general configured to work
    pretty well out of the box. Now enjoy your even more native app with the swipeable tabs! You can also find a video version
    of this Quick Win below.
